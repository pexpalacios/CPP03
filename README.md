# CPP03
42 Milestone 4

This module is about class inheritance. It uses ClapTrap and it's different types as classes (for some reason).

### CPP 03
- ex 00: Aaaaand... OPEN!
```
	Create a class with some private attributes and unique functions
```
- ex 01: Serena, my love!
```
	Make a child of the previous class changing some functions' behaviour
```
- ex 02:  Repetitive work
```
	Make a second different child that comes from the same parent and changes behaviours to different ones
```
- ex 03: Now itâ€™s weird!
```
	Make a grandchild using diamond inheritance, using both of the previous children as parents
```
